            String what = "nothing";
            String firstName = "John";
            String delimiter = " ";
            String lastName = "Snow";
            String exclamationMark = "!";

        s1 = "s2";
        s2 = "s1";
        s1 = s1;

        What are the values of s1 and s2 variables after the last line?
        // 

Task #4:
